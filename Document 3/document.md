 Steps Taken to Build and Integrate Components

1. Setting Up the Environment

Used Next.js for server-side rendering and seamless routing.

Configured TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.

Installed and set up Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. Database and CMS Integration

Integrated Sanity CMS to manage dynamic product content.

Structured schemas for products, categories, and user orders.

Fetched and displayed data using Sanity’s GROQ queries.

3. Building Core Features

Product Display:

Developed dynamic product pages with detailed information fetched from Sanity.

Implemented category options.

Add to Cart:

Used React Context API to manage cart state globally.

Allowed users to add, update, and remove items from the cart.

Persisted cart data in localStorage to maintain state across sessions.

Search Functionality:

Implemented a search bar using debounced queries to fetch matching products.

 Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

1. Dynamic Routing for Product Pages

Challenge: Managing product slugs and ensuring fast page rendering.

Solution: Used getStaticPaths and getStaticProps to pre-render pages at build time for faster load speeds.

2. Managing State Across Components

Challenge: Maintaining consistent cart state.

Solution: Implemented the React Context API for global state management.

3. Responsive Design

Challenge: Ensuring the website’s responsiveness across devices.

Solution: Utilized Tailwind CSS’s responsive utility classes to design a mobile-first interface.

4. Payment Integration Issues

Challenge: Handling Stripe’s webhooks for order verification.

Solution: Used Next.js’s API routes to securely verify transactions.

5. CMS Data Fetching

Challenge: Managing GROQ queries for complex relationships between products and categories.

Solution: Optimized queries and used Sanity’s preview mode for real-time data updates during development.

Best Practices Followed During Development

1) Code Quality and Maintainability:

Used TypeScript to prevent runtime errors.

Followed modular coding practices to ensure reusability.

2) Performance Optimization:

Implemented lazy loading for images using Next.js’s Image component.

Used server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance.

3) User Experience:

Designed an intuitive and responsive UI.

Used debounced search for smooth user interactions.
